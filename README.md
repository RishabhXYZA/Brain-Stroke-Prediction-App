Build a Brain Stroke Predictor streamlit application

# ðŸ’» Technologies Used
Python,Numpy,Pandas,Streamlit,Machine Learning(Logistic Regression,LDA,Random Forest),Plotly

# ðŸš€ Features
1. Performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to identify patterns and correlations in health data
2. Applied data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling)
3. Built and evaluated multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LDA.) for prediction
4. Selected the best-performing model based on ROC Curve
5. Deployed the final model into a Streamlit web application with a user-friendly interface
6. Integrated data visualization (charts/graphs) to enhance interpretability of results
