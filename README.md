# Brain-Stroke-Prediction-App
Build a Brain Stroke Predictor streamlit application

💻 Technologies Used
Python,Numpy,Pandas,Streamlit,Machine Learning(Logistic Regression,LDA,Random Forest),Plotly

🚀 Features
🔹Performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to identify patterns and correlations in health data.
🔹Applied data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling).
🔹Built and evaluated multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LDA.) for prediction.
🔹Selected the best-performing model based on ROC Curve.
🔹Deployed the final model into a Streamlit web application with a user-friendly interface.
🔹Integrated data visualization (charts/graphs) to enhance interpretability of results.
